# CS5044 Practical II

## Rat Sightings in New York City

This practical investigates rat sightings from 2010 to 2020 in New York City, USA. Based on reports to the 
City of New York, two visuals have been generated and assembled into a dashboard (which can be 
accessed at either of the two links above). This dashboard is composed of two visuals, a brief description and several toggle options. 
Based on a subset of available data, the visuals seek to provide the viewer a broad understanding of the 
presence of rats in NYC, how sightings have changed over time and the distributions of reports across 
the different boroughs of NYC.
